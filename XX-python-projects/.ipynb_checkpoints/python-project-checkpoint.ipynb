    "Before starting to code your brains out, it's worth taking a look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends). Familiarize yourself with the basic functionalities of the website. Search for something and try to get the data in csv form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to think about:\n",
    "- Google Trends normalizes the data so that the peak search interest in the results corresponds to a value of 100. You can't unnormalize the data, but maybe it can actually save you time! Ask: How would I normalize anyways?\n",
    "- With this in mind, should you search for both candidates simultaneously or for one at a time?\n",
    "- There are different options to search: search terms and concepts. Which should you use?\n",
    "- We want to have a time series for each state. There two main ways to accomplish this: export the time series for each state or export the data in the map for each time point. Which should you use?\n",
    "- can you use a static method or will you have to used a dynamic webdriver?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step-by-step guide we will compare both search terms simultaneously and export the map data for every day in the year leading up to the election. If the volume is very low, Google doesn't report anything. Although there exists a [workaround](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272714000929) we won't bother with it here."
